        <p> My name is Dylan Guzman and I am currently a 3rd-Year Software Engineering Major at California Baptist
            University. My previous work experience amounts to some development of web applications utilizing shopify,
            shipstation, and using json to edit shopify sites.
            I would love the opportunity to pursue a position where I can work alongside actual Software Engineers
            developing real world code. I would love a perspective and view into the process of software development
            while also sharpening my coding abilities with new information and potential new languages.</p>
        <p> I am an outgoing and team oriented individual who loves working with teams and alongside mentors. I am always
            searching for newer and better ways of doing things and am always open to feedback and criticism. I have a lot of
            experience working as both team member and team leader and would love the opportunity to prove myself.</p>
        <p> I am currently very proficient in java but as of the end of this semester will have completed coursework in
            databases and a project based on javascript(React). I would work diligently on all projects and push
            myself to learn as much about the industry and software as possible. I specifically would love the opportunity
            to work on any projects involving front end or backend development as I have found a large passion for those
            fields.
        </p>
        <p>Thank you again for the consideration of my employment,</p>
        <p>-Dylan Guzman</p>
